# CSE160-DogsheepBeta
A simple WolframAlpha knockoff 

Originally developed as cse160Proj, but this name is better

Originally developed as a way to propagate uncertainty in my physics labs

Rewrite and improvements inspired by [MuPad](https://web.archive.org/web/20070611154809/http://www-math.uni-paderborn.de/~stefanw/Papers/mathPAD_Vol11_art07.pdf), the precursor to WolframAlpha
